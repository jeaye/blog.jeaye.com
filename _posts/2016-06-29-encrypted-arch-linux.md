On a typical GNU/Linux install, you won't have disk encryption. Though you're a
keen user and you've chosen a [very strong
passphrase](https://libraryfreedomproject.org/strongpassphrases/), your data is
still stored openly. Should anyone steal, confiscate, buy, or otherwise obtain
your hard drive, every bit of data is going to be readable. Should anyone boot
into a live CD on your system and mount your drives, your data is readily
available and your strong passphrase is none the wiser.

### Varying degrees of encryption
It's becoming more popular to encrypt certain files, [perhaps using
GPG](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x110.html), and even home directories.
This still suffers, compared to full system encryption, since the entire root
of the file system is still open.  Directories like `/etc`, where the majority
of your system configurations exist (often including sensitive information),
`/var`, where sensitive data may be logged by running processes, and even
`/tmp`, where processes may store sensitive temporary data, are vulnerable.

*Encrypt first, then install; use your system with more confidence.*

### Start here
Let this be a guide for your next bare-bones Arch setup. I assume you're the
root from here on out.

#### Download
Head over to the [Arch download site](https://www.archlinux.org/download/) and
get the latest ISO, preferably via BitTorrent. Burn it to your external media in
your preferred manner; I have a 16GB USB drive at `/dev/sdb`, in this example,
and I'll make my live disk with one command.

```bash
$ dd if=archlinux-2016.07.01-dual.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=1M
```

Boot into your new live CD, choose your architecture, and you'll be dropped at
a root prompt. Now you'll create your system.

#### Partition
I'm assuming you're installing to `/dev/sda`; the resulting partition table is
shown below.

```text
/dev/sda1   /boot   200MB
/dev/sda2   /       Rest
```

Spin up [cfdisk](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Cfdisk) and create a
matching layout.

```bash
$ cfdisk /dev/sda
```

#### Encrypt
Now, before you install anything, you're going to setup encryption for
`/dev/sda2`. Choose a strong passphrase, at least 32 characters long. I
recommend using a complete sentence with spaces, punctuation, and mixed case. As
the disk is encrypted, it'll first be scrubbed with random data. You can
interrupt this, but you should not! Here's why.

Typical data [can be
discovered](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Securely_wipe_disk) by
patterns that are inherent to its format.  Video, audio, source code, etc, each
looks different as a pattern of bits. Encrypted data typically looks like
random garbage. As a result, if you only encrypt the data of this new system,
there may be old data on the drive which will not look random; it'll still be
decipherable as video, audio, etc. If you randomize the whole drive first, then
it's substantially more difficult to tell where the encrypted data stops, since
it all looks like random garbage.

```bash
$ cryptsetup --verbose --key-size 512 --hash sha512 --iter-time 5000 \
             --use-random luksFormat /dev/sda2
```

Given an encrypted partition, which `/dev/sda2` now is, you can decrypt it into
a labeled volume. In this example, you'll decrypt the fresh `/dev/sda2` into
`/dev/mapper/cryptroot`.

```bash
$ cryptsetup open --type luks /dev/sda2 cryptroot
```

Once it's there, you're free to mount it, format it, or do just about anything
you would with a normal disk partition.


#### Format
Both of the partitions will just use [Ext4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4),
in this example. You're welcome to use any file system you'd like.

```bash
$ mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1
$ mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/cryptroot
```

Once you have your file systems formatted, they should be mounted in a local
directory. You'll change root into here soon.

```bash
$ mkdir -p mnt
$ mount -t ext4 /dev/mapper/cryptroot mnt
$ mkdir -p mnt/boot
$ mount -t ext4 /dev/sda1 mnt/boot
```

#### Install the base system
The Arch live system comes with a couple of commands to help bootstrap your new
system. The first you'll use is `pacstrap`, which takes the directory in which
to install and an arbitrary number of packages. This requires network access and
I recommend installing some basic tools which will help as you build up your
system. Aside from the required `base` and `base-devel`, I opt for `vim` and
`tmux`.

```bash
$ pacstrap -i mnt base base-devel vim tmux
```

Your current mount points will work as a starting point for the new system, so
you can serialize them as an fstab now.

```bash
$ genfstab -U -p mnt >> mnt/etc/fstab
```

#### Enter the system
At this point, a working user-space is within `mnt` and you an change root into
it. Arch provides `arch-chroot` for this purpose; it's a helper script around
`chroot` which also sets up certain API file systems and makes
`/etc/resolv.conf` available.

```bash
$ arch-chroot mnt
```

#### Setup locale
Now that you're in your new system's environment, some essential information
will need to be specified. For starters, a modern setup should [default to
UTF-8](http://utf8everywhere.org/).

```bash
$ sed -i 's/^#\(en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8\)/\1/g' /etc/locale.gen
$ locale-gen

$ echo LANG=en_US.UTF-8 > /etc/locale.conf
$ export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```

#### Setup time
Link in the appropriate time zone for you. I also recommend keeping the hardware
clock on UTC.

```bash
$ ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Los_Angeles /etc/localtime

$ hwclock --systohc --utc
```

#### Setup hostname
Your hostname can be whatever you want; it's network-visible though, so keep it
sane.

```bash
$ echo tofu-ninja > /etc/hostname
```

#### Setup users
Root needs a password and you'll need a normal user. Using root for anything but
short-term administrative tasks is a [dangerous habit](https://askubuntu.com/questions/16178/why-is-it-bad-to-login-as-root).

```bash
$ passwd # enter root password

$ useradd -m -g users -G wheel -s /bin/bash penny
$ passwd penny # enter user's password

$ visudo # uncomment wheel
```

#### Install GRUB
You have other options for your bootloader, but
[GRUB](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GRUB) is the most powerful around.
I like that, in a pinch, the GRUB shell can be used to boot just about
anything. The installation is straightforward, but you need to make sure that
GRUB knows about our encrypted drive.

```bash
$ pacman -S grub-bios

$ sed -i 's#^\(GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="\)#\1cryptdevice=/dev/sda2:cryptroot#' \
         /etc/default/grub

$ grub-install --recheck /dev/sda
$ grub-mkconfig --output /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

#### Rebuild initramfs
The kernel needs to know about your encrypted setup, so you must instruct
[mkinitcpio](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/mkinitcpio) to do some extra
work.

```bash
$ sed -i 's/^\(HOOKS=".*\)\(filesystems.*\)/\1 encrypt \2/' \
         /etc/mkinitcpio.conf
$ mkinitcpio -p linux
```

#### Reboot
At this point, your minimal setup is complete and your entire system, save for
`/boot`, is encrypted. You can exit the install environment and reboot into
GRUB and your new install.

```bash
$ exit
$ umount -R mnt/boot
$ umount -R mnt
$ cryptsetup close cryptroot
$ reboot
```

### If you get locked out
If locked out of your system, for whatever reason, you'll need to manually
decrypt your drives. You can do this by just manually opening and closing
through `cryptsetup`, like you did for the install.

```bash
$ cryptsetup open --type luks /dev/sda2 cryptroot
$ mkdir -p mnt
$ mount -t ext4 /dev/mapper/cryptroot mnt
$ mkdir -p mnt/boot
$ mount -t ext4 /dev/sda1 mnt/boot

# Do your work ...

$ umount -R mnt/boot
$ umount -R mnt
$ cryptsetup close cryptroot
```
