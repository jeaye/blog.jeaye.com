I want to tackle an issue which seems prevalent in the modern software
engineering industry. The idea, laid down by [Steve
Jobs](http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Real_Artists_Ship.txt), is that
“real artists ship” and everyone else is forgotten. What does it mean to be a
“real artist,” and what does it mean to “ship” as one? Unfortunately, it's
become a facade, analogous to
[YOLO](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Yolo), intended to cover
one's tracks of poor engineering practices, lack of tooling, and lack
of concern for the success of the product beyond delivery.

### It's not a joke
Many people do say “real artists ship” as joke, when knowingly tolerating some
poor practice. The problem worth pointing out is that, while this said in jest,
it's actually masking the underlying issue in unsettling humor. It's become
affordable, in engineering social circles and development teams, to subvert good
software practice in favor of reaching deadlines -- and here's the kicker --
with no intention of returning to the code to refactor.

Furthermore, it's become an attack against those who do care about software
quality. In this form, it's not a joke at all, but a claim from a high horse
that shipped products are not polished products, or stable products, or secure
products, but at least they're shipped. A lunch-time conversation between two
equal-ranked devs may go like this:

Sally: *“Did you get tests written for the new notification system?”*

Heather: *“No, I needed to get it out the door.”*

Sally: *“Yeah, that deadline was tight. Do you plan on getting the tests written
before the next sprint?”*

Heather: *“No, I don't think they're important. The code works and it's live.”*

Sally: *“It is important, since it's such a core system; we can verify all parts
of it behave as expected, and protect against regressions, with tests.”*

Heather: *“If we do it your way, Sally, we never ship. Real artists ship.”*

### The philosophy
Like so many other aspects in this world, software practices are treated as
black and white. You're either apparently a “real artist,” who ships, or you're
someone who cares about the quality of your product and you never ship. Surely,
this is absurd. Everything is gray, not black or white, and modern software
engineering is neither the Kung Fu nor the Aikido nor the Wrestling; it's the
mixed martial arts, pulling the most practical pieces from as many sources as
possible.

#### Testing
Having software tests typically means one thing, specifically: you care, or are
required to care, about software quality. Do companies with automated tests
actually ship code? Let's take a look at the big four.

1. [Google](https://testing.googleblog.com/2011/01/how-google-tests-software.html)
2. [Amazon](http://www.zdnet.com/article/how-amazon-handles-a-new-software-deployment-every-second/)
3. [Facebook (Video)](https://youtu.be/OJ94KqmsxiI?t=1393)
4. [Microsoft](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/microsoft_press/2009/02/13/new-book-how-we-test-software-at-microsoft/)

Ok, let's try smaller companies.

1. [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/blog/rewriting-your-test-suite-in-clojure-in-24-hours/)
2. [AirBnB](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/)
3. [Uber](https://eng.uber.com/tech-stack-part-one/)
4. [Github](http://githubengineering.com/move-fast/)
5. [Assertible](https://assertible.com/blog/test-every-single-api-deployment)

What about some of the big open source projects?

1. [Linux](https://linux-test-project.github.io/)
2. [Krita](https://community.kde.org/Krita/Docs/Unittests_in_Krita)
3. [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Automated_testing)
4. [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html)
5. [Emacs](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/UnitTesting)
6. [NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Unit-tests)

My experience is primarily in game development, where software testing is
apparently far less common. Imperative programming exacerbates this
problem, since impure functions are harder to test, but games, and especially
game engines, are just as testable as anything else. Again, some examples.

1. [UnrealEngine](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/Automation/index.html)
2. [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/test-suites)
3. [Crytek](http://www.crytek.com/cryengine/cryengine3/presentations/aaa-automated-testing-for-aaa-games)
4. [RIOT](https://engineering.riotgames.com/news/automated-testing-league-legends)
5. [CCP/Eve Online](https://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/eve-probe/)

Clearly, it's entirely possible to have automated tests running continuously,
alongside your typical QA. The best thing about it is, you can still ship! Even
better, you can both ship and iterate more confidently. If you do have to ship
without testing, in order to meet some external deadline, fine. Will you test
next sprint? Will you ensure there are no regressions in functionality or
performance?

No stance on this should be religious; in every aspect, we must be pragmatic.
Too much testing and you may not meet your deadline. Too little of it and you
may not meet many users, or you may struggle to keep them. Build a company
around a foundation of untested code, continue to accrue hundreds of thousands
of lines of it, and then expect stability and performance? That is not sane.

*NOTE: A common argument: "But interactive applications are impossible to test!" Ok, they require a different setup, but [Xamarin does it](https://www.xamarin.com/test-cloud), [PhantomJS does it](http://phantomjs.org/), [Android does it](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/ui-testing/index.html), [iOS does it](http://blog.manbolo.com/2012/04/08/ios-automated-tests-with-uiautomation), and even [Unity3D does it](http://doctrina-kharkov.blogspot.com/2016/08/cultorios-automated-unity-game-testing-tutorial.html).*

*ANOTHER NOTE: Many devs seem to think that testing means writing unit tests for
each function in the codebase. Fortunately, that's far from the truth. There are
a number of [types of
tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing#Testing_levels) and a
system can be reasonably well tested without a single unit test.*

#### Refactoring
“Real artists” also seem to not have time to refactor old code. Write it once, get
it done, and ship it. If you're one of those devs who goes back, after cranking
out a new system, and removes duplication, improves API type safety, or adds
more assertions and documentation, you may not be a “real artist.” Worse,
according to them, you may never ship.

Refactoring code should be thought of as code hygiene. Just as most of us shower
regularly, brush our teeth, and wipe after shitting, we need to clean up our
code and fight bit rot; feature work, in a short sprint, can be very dirty work!
The social norm, it seems, has us hiding from those who don't shower, but
embracing those who skip on the refactoring, anointing them as “real artists.”

“At GitHub we try not to brag about the “shortcuts” we’ve taken over the
years to scale our web application to more than 12 million users. In fact,
we do quite the opposite: we make a conscious effort to study our codebase
looking for systems that can be rewritten to be cleaner, simpler and more
efficient, and we develop tools and workflows that allow us to perform these
rewrites efficiently and reliably.” ~ <a href="http://githubengineering.com/move-fast/">Github Engineering</a>

#### Learning
It also seems that “real artists” claim to know all that's needed for shipping
their products; anything new, no matter how old the teachings may be, is
superfluous. However, I'd argue that there is always room for growth. We should
always be striving to improve our craft. We should always be looking to
modernize our practices. We can greatly benefit from reflecting on our flaws, or
even having our code reviewed by the team. Yet these ideas are not of the “real
artist.”

The more one observes “real artists,” the more it becomes clear that they are
entirely one dimensional. They're built to ship, regardless of parameters, and
will sacrifice anything to do so. Technical debt will accrue without bound and,
after years, the hope to gain a firm grasp of the product's stability and
behavior will be immaterial.

### The damage
The army of “real artists” may have barricaded your workplace. If so, you'll be
met with great reluctance when trying to introduce code reviews, continuous
integration, and modern safety practices. You'll be labeled an extremist for
calling out and proposing fixes for poor tooling, bit-rotten systems, and
haggard practices. You may find solace in some colleagues, but only rigidity on
a department level.

Consider the effect of this behavior on the product. Can you release
continuously? Probably not; getting stable binaries out is a slow chug, so bugs
linger. Are your users frustrated that your software crashes often? That goes
without saying. Is your new-user experience poor because of your degrading
performance? Can you address this without systemic changes? Is your poor
developer tooling hurting the productivity of your devs and significantly
increasing your iteration time? Is is troubling to on-board new devs, given the
poor documentation and [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) of
your proprietary tech?

Gaming is a [$100 billion
market](https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/global-games-market-reaches-99-6-billion-2016-mobile-generating-37/);
mobile comprises a third of that. How much is your company losing because the
“real artists” are so quick to ship bugs?

If you're hunting for a job, be sure to make note of the culture around quality.
When you're interviewing, ask the interviewers about their software practices. Is
there automated testing? Are there code reviews? Static analysis? Linting?
What's the test coverage? What sort of tests are there? Is there a style guide
which prohibits certain dangerous practices? Are third-party libraries kept up
to date to minimize security holes and duplicated patching efforts? What's the
most stale system? Is there time between feature sprints to refactor code?

### A final note to “real artists”
I'd note that we all ship quick and dirty hacks; what matters is that we go back
and clean them up. Every step of the way, we should be pragmatic and focused on
maintaining quality software; that doesn't need to get in the way of shipping,
but it does need to be done. I'd note that repeated bastardization of software
practices leads to an unmaintainable mess. I'd ask you to attempt to quantify
the summation of all “real artist” moments you've had, where sane practice was
abandoned. Was it worth it? What was the cost? Are you still paying for it?
