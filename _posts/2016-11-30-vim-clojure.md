Those in Emacs land need not worry about excellent Lisp and REPL support. Here
in Vim land, however, the ground is less certain. There have been a myriad of
attempts to provide Paredit-like editing and SLIME-like evaluating to those who
edit modally. Here's a contemporary look at helping Vim provide the expected
slurpage, barfage, evaluation, and more.

*What's slurping and barfingâ€¦? See [here](http://danmidwood.com/content/2014/11/21/animated-paredit.html).*

### The lineup
The key plugins I use for Clojure are listed below. As mentioned in a [previous
post](https://blog.jeaye.com/2015/12/31/vim-qt/), I'm running
[Vim-Qt](https://bitbucket.org/equalsraf/vim-qt/wiki/Home) and my Vim configs
are [here](https://github.com/jeaye/vimrc).

[Venantius](https://venanti.us/) has done an excellent job, in [his
blog](http://blog.venanti.us/clojure-vim/), covering the ins and outs of most of
these plugins; I think that his post is certainly worth reading before
continuing here.

### What's new?
The big difference between this setup and Venantius' is the change from
[Paredit.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3998) to vim-sexp.
vim-sexp showed up a couple of years ago and filled in a hole which was sorely
left gaping: repeatability. Paredit.vim suffers a fatal flaw, in that it rebinds
`.` to do its own repeating and it breaks core Vim functionality. Depending on
your workflow, this is a deal breaker. If you ever user `.` to not retype what
you just typed, this is a deal breaker.

vim-sexp just works, when it comes to repeating, partially due to its
compatibility with tpope's `vim-repeat`. It also is less strict than Paredit
when it comes to manually unbalancing parens, which can annoyingly get in the
way in non-trivial use cases. Furthermore, Paredit's rigidity, in that sense,
also leads to situations where parens are left unbalanced by an edit, yet Paredit
thinks otherwise and won't allow one to easily correct the issue.

Alas, vim-sexp's key flaw appears to be that its bindings are unapproachable.
This is primarily due to their Emacs-esque meta *chords*, rather that Vim's
idiomatic *melodies*.  tpope saved the day, again, with sarcasm and
vim-sexp-mappings-for-regular-people.  Take a look at the
[README](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sexp-mappings-for-regular-people) for an
example of how minimal and clean the mappings have become. Combined with
vim-surround, as Venantius said, Vim becomes a formidable s-expression wrangler.

### Pitfalls to dodge


#### Start your REPL first
Since vim-fireplace relies on connecting to the nREPL for its inner workings,
and manually connecting to such a REPL is tedious, consider just starting the
REPL before opening up Vim.

#### When using vim-fireplace, no `.nrepl-port` file is found
If you need to manually `:Connect` and type in your nREPL port, there's
something wrong. I've found that `lein repl` creates the appropriate
`.nrepl-port` file, while `lein trampoline repl` does not. I've created an
[issue](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/issues/2224) on Leiningen's
Github; we'll see if this is a bug or something intentional.


### Final thoughts
It's an exciting time to be in the Clojure world. For those interested in
Clojure and game development, take a look at
[Arcadia](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/arcadia) for the ability to combine
Clojure and Unity. There's also initial support for connecting the Unity Clojure
REPL to vim-fireplace, using
[arcadia.nrepl](https://github.com/spacepluk/arcadia.nrepl).
