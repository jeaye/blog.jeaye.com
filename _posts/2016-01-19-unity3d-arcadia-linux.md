For the past decade, [Unity3D](http://madewith.unity.com/) has lacked official
GNU/Linux support. Some tenacious users have [worked around this with
WINE](https://github.com/Unity3D-Wine-Support/Unity3D-on-Wine), with varying
degrees of success. Fortunately for us GNU/Linux users, [Unity3D is now officially
available
](http://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/08/26/unity-comes-to-linux-experimental-build-now-available/)
and support is provided in the new [Linux
forums](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/unity-on-linux-release-notes-and-known-issues.350256/).
To improve the situation further,
[Arcadia](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia) is also compatible with this
new GNU/Linux build. I'll cover here how to get things up and running.

### My setup
I'm currently running Arch Linux and using the proprietary nVidia drivers for my
two GTX 670MX cards. This should work on just about any distro, but you should
be sure to use the latest graphics drivers you can; Unity is undoubtedly heavy.

### Installing Unity3D
To get going, hop on over to the [release
thread](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/unity-on-linux-release-notes-and-known-issues.350256/)
and navigate to the last post. If you're on a Debian-based distribution, you'll
be happy to just find a deb you can install. For the rest of us, there's an
awkwardly unconventional shell script we can run, which also comes with some
binary data embedded in it (~2GB in size). Fair warning.

You should pull down the latest; the commands below are what I used and there
may be a newer version for you. Note that, if you read the script, root is
required for the use of a [chromium suid
sandbox](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/linux_suid_sandbox.md). Fair warning.

```bash
$ installer=unity-editor-installer-5.3.1f1+20160106.sh
$ wget http://download.unity3d.com/download_unity/linux/$installer
$ chmod +x ./$installer
$ su - -c "cd $PWD ; ./$installer"
```

The dependencies can also be found in the [release thread](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/unity-on-linux-release-notes-and-known-issues.350256/) and are left to you to figure out.

#### Issues on startup
There's an existing issue where Unity, once installed, requires some directories
which it's apparently unable to create. To be safe, before running Unity, you
should run:

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/unity3d/Unity
```

Also, don't forget to install `npm`, which crept up on me silently. Unity won't
complain about not having it, the start screen just won't show anything.

#### Running Unity
Assuming all went well, you should be able to start up Unity, sign in, and
create some new projects.

```bash
$ ./unity-editor-5.3.1f1/Editor/Unity
```

From here, continue on with your normal Unity workflow
and report all bugs, crashes, etc to the [Unity
forums](http://forum.unity3d.com/forums/linux-editor-support-feedback-experimental.93/).

### What is Arcadia?
[Arcadia](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia) is a new project which
integrates [Clojure CLR](http://clojure.org/about/clojureclr) (Clojure on .NET)
with Unity. This allows not only for writing Unity components, logic, etc in
Clojure, it also allows for integrating a Clojure REPL into the Unity editor for
programmatic manipulation of the scene. We'll see, briefly, what I mean.

#### Installing Arcadia
To install Arcadia, just clone it into the `Assets` directory of your current
project.

```bash
$ cd ~/projects/my-unity-game/Assets
$ git clone -b develop https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia.git
```

If things don't work out of the box, you can take a look at their provided
[Getting
Started](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia/wiki/getting-started) wiki
page.

#### Using the REPL
Once Arcadia is installed, we can spin up a Clojure REPL and try interacting
with the Unity editor.

```bash
$ cd ~/projects/my-unity-game
$ ruby ./Assets/Arcadia/Editor/repl-client.rb
```

Once you're in the REPL, we can verify everything is sane.

```clojure
user=> (+ 1 41)
42
```

Now let's interact with the Unity editor.

```clojure
user=> (def cube (create-primitive :cube))
#'user/cube
```

If you look back into the Unity window, you'll find that the cube you created is
now part of the scene. This means you can use Clojure, in a REPL, to
programmatically manipulate your scene before even running the game. A possible
use for this would be creating procedural content before hand, instead of at
run-time.

Perhaps the most useful aspect of the REPL here is how it can automate work for
you, which would otherwise involve the mouse in the editor. I can select any
object in the scene, with my mouse, and then move over to the REPL can gain
access to it.

```clojure
user=> (import Selection)
user=> (Selection/activeObject)
#<GameObject Plane (UnityEngine.GameObject)>
```

If I select multiple objects, I can get a sequence of all of them in Clojure.

```clojure
user=> (Selection/objects)
(#<GameObject Plane (UnityEngine.GameObject)> #<GameObject Water (UnityEngine.GameObject)>)
```

With this sequence, I could do any number of operations, from renaming,
resizing, parenting, destroying, adding or removing components, etc.

#### Naming Clojure files
One aspect on which I want to touch is just how finicky Arcadia can be with
namespacing and file paths. If my project is called ninjakitten and my file is
called milk.clj, the path should be `Assets/ninjakitten/milk.clj` and the
corresponding Clojure namespace should be:

```clojure
(ns ninjakitten.milk
  (:use arcadia.core))
```

#### Helpful Arcadia resources
Arcadia has a [Gittr channel](https://gitter.im/arcadia-unity/Arcadia), a
[mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/arcadia-unity), and an
IRC channel on Freenode `#arcadiaunity`. Aside from that, there are a couple of
great demos on Youtube, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBvNIJzlWEI) and
