With the rise of free encryption through [Let's
Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), and the weight of global surveillance on our
minds, adopting HTTPS is now more important than ever. Github now allows
unforced HTTPS for its `username.github.io` domains, but that coverage doesn't
carry over to those using custom domains. The approach I'm using for this blog
and my [home page](https://jeaye.com/), by way of reverse proxy, is documented
herein.

### Github behavior change (May 2016)
Github has "fixed a bug" which now causes issues with this setup, since the
presence of the `CNAME` file will redirect to your custom domain, but your
custom domain will act as a reverse proxy to the `github.io` address, thus
causing an infinite loop. The simple solution is to delete the `CNAME` file
in your repo when you set this up; it's not needed with this approach.

### SSL Certs

Before any HTTPS configuration can be setup, SSL certs are required. I use
[simp_le](https://github.com/kuba/simp_le),
which is a Let's Encrypt front-end, and [NixOS](http://nixos.org/)
([related
configs](https://github.com/jeaye/nix-files/blob/master/service/acme.nix)); there are [many others to
consider](https://www.metachris.com/2015/12/comparison-of-10-acme-lets-encrypt-clients/)
though. Let's assume you're building your new website `honest-kittens.org`. Be
sure to include at least `www.honest-kittens.org` in your certificate as well.

### The Apache proxy

The way to get around Github's lack of SSL support for custom domains is to have
that domain use a proxy server which talks to Github and the client. This isn't
very much work, compared to hosting a complete Jekyll stack, so we still benefit
from Github's convenient hosting. To minimize the scope of this post, I assume
you're familiar with administrating an Apache server.

You'll need to load the `proxy` and `proxy_http` modules before anything. Apply
the following, updating the paths as needed:

```apache
LoadModule proxy_module       modules/mod_proxy.so
LoadModule proxy_http_module  modules/mod_proxy_http.so
```

In the virtual host for `honest-kittens.org`, we can enable the proxy engine
using:

```apache
SSLProxyEngine On
ProxyPreserveHost Off
```

This will also ensure that, when talking to Github, the proxy server doesn't use
the `honest-kittens.org` host. If it did, the SSL discussion would fail. To have
Apache relay `honest-kittens.org/` to `username.github.io/`, where `username` is
your username, we setup a proxy pass:

```apache
ProxyPass / https://username.github.io/
```

**NOTE:** My placement of trailing slashes is deliberate and extremely
important, as is my usage of **https** vs **http**.

Github's server may, for various reasons, send over a 301 redirect request. With
just this configuration, the request will be forwarded to the client unmodified,
causing them to end up at `username.github.io`. That's no good. We'll setup a
reverse proxy to ensure such a redirect from Github is changed before it hits
the client:

```apache
ProxyPassReverse / https://username.github.io/
ProxyPassReverse / http://username.github.io/
```

This covers both the HTTP and HTTPS cases, ensuring that links matching the
above `username.github.io` will be translated into the root level of
`honest-kittens.org`. The only additional configuration necessary is for
bringing in the SSL certs and ensuring no weak ciphers are used:

```apache
SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/honest-kittens.org/key.pem
SSLCertificateChainFile /path/to/honest-kittens.org/chain.pem
SSLCertificateFile /path/to/honest-kittens.org/cert.pem
SSLProtocol All -SSLv2 -SSLv3
SSLCipherSuite HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5:!EXP
SSLHonorCipherOrder on
```

### Updating your Jekyll configuration

At this point, our Github Pages site needs one tweak before all of this will
work together. We could use mod_proxy_html to rewrite all of the references to
our `username.github.io` site, within the HTML, or we could just change our
`_config.yml`, and the like, to be aware of our custom domain. The choice is
yours, but I'll describe the latter.

```yaml
site: https://honest-kittens.org
```

After setting the site's url in Jekyll's configuration, we should use it for all
file references within our site. That is, our `main.css` might come in as:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% raw %}{{ site.url }}{% endraw %}/css/main.css" />
```

The `{% raw %}{{ site.url }}{% endraw %}` is a
[Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) expression which will be
replaced by the value in your configuration.

### Forcing HTTPS

Now that your reverse proxy is setup, it's crucial that you force your users
onto HTTPS and keep them there. [This
article](https://www.ssl.com/how-to/force-https-connections-in-an-apache-server-environment/)
covers how to do that simply using Apache. Since I'm using NixOS, I can just
specify a global redirect:

```nix
services.httpd.virtualHosts =
[
  {
    hostName = "honest-kittens.org";
    serverAliases = [ "www.honest-kittens.org" ];
    globalRedirect = "https://honest-kittens.org/";
  }
];
```

Note that it's also important to add a server alias for `www.honest-kittens.org`
in both your HTTP redirect and your SSL-enabled virtual host.

### The Let's Encrypt effect

According to a [very recent
post](https://tacticalsecret.com/early-impacts-of-letsencrypt/) by [J.C.
Jones](https://twitter.com/jamespugjones), Let's Encrypt is now the fourth
largest CA for public web certs. Even more interesting, 93% of all sites using
Let's Encrypt didn't have a previous SSL certificate; this means more and more
new sites, or previously unencrypted sites, are picking up encryption for free.
