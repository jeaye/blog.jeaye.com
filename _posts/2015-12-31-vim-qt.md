title: From Vim-GTK to Vim-Qt

[Vim-Qt](https://bitbucket.org/equalsraf/vim-qt/wiki/Home) is a gVim replacement
which aims to address a number of graphical issues in the standard GTK-based
Vim. After having used the default gVim for years, and putting up a number of
its quirks, I decided to give Vim-Qt a run for its money. In short, I was
pleasantly surprised.

### The state of Vim-GTK
My most notable gripes with gVim are regarding its cell rendering. If the
`guifont` setting doesn't perfectly match the width of the window, in that
`(window_width % character_with) == 0`, there is some remaining space which is
left uncolored on the right side of the window. Depending on your font size and
window width, that can be almost a full character's width. To remedy this, one
needs to influence the GTK renderer using external configs; I haven't had
much luck with it.

Aside from that, gVim's actual GUI elements aren't configurable. Sure, you can
`:set guiopts-=m` to remove the menu, but you can't change the size, color, and
font of the tabs. You also have no control over where the tool bars render. Note
that each issue described here is also present in Vim-GNOME and other Vim GUIs
based on Vim-GTK.

### What Vim-Qt offers
Vim-Qt has packages available for
[Debian](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/ruiabreuferreira/),
[Ubuntu](https://launchpad.net/~equalsraf/+archive/ppa),
[Chakra](http://chakraos.org/ccr/packages.php?ID=1916),
[Arch](http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=50082), and
[Gentoo](http://packages.gentoo.org/package/app-editors/vim-qt). Right out of
the box, Vim-Qt resolves the window background color issue. Aside from that, it
also cleans up the tabs a bit, with the help of Qt, so they look a
bit more sleek.

</a>

</div>

Vim-Qt takes advantage of its powerful Qt backend by allowing [dockable tool
bars](https://bitbucket.org/equalsraf/vim-qt/wiki/Features), which adds a great
deal of flexibility over the placement of tabs, file menus, and other widgets.
The most powerful feature, however, is its support for [Qt style
sheets](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/stylesheet.html), which give you full control
over each individual element in the GUI. After some exploring, and this config,
I was able to turn my Vim-Qt setup into something much more minimal; it also
fits my color scheme just as I'd like.

```css
MainWindow
{ background : #002b36; }

QToolBar
{
  border-bottom : 1px solid #333333;
  qproperty-movable: false;
}

QToolButton
{
  qproperty-icon: "";
  qproperty-text: "";
}

QTabBar
{
  qproperty-tabsClosable: false;
  font-size: 20px;
}

QTabBar::tab
{
  background : transparent;
  color : #839496;
  border : 1px solid #333;
  padding : 5px;
  padding-left : 10px;
  padding-right : 10px;
  border-radius : 4px;
}

QTabBar::tab::selected
{ color: #cb4b16; }

QTabBar::close-button
{ image: ""; }

### Where Vim-Qt is lacking
Oddly enough, Vim-Qt doesn't have a man page. [Its
README](https://github.com/equalsraf/vim-qt/blob/master/README.md) is just
copied from Vim verbatim. Fortunately, the [wiki on
BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/equalsraf/vim-qt/wiki/Home) has some
documentation on compilation and installation. Having a look through [its
issues](https://bitbucket.org/equalsraf/vim-qt/issues?status=new&status=open),
it seems that development on the project may have stalled. Hopefully things will
pick back up in the new year.

Vim-Qt comes in two flavors: Qt4 and Qt5. Unfortunately, the Qt5 version has
some very annoying flickering issues when paging, jumping, and scrolling. I
haven't had any such issues with the Qt4 version though; consider it more
stable. Many people have it out for Qt, to begin with, and run a system without
Qt installed. I happen to need it, since I need Skype for work, so Vim-Qt didn't
require any extra dependencies.

If in doubt, there's a small, albeit helpful, Vim-Qt IRC channel on frenode:
`##vim_qt`.

### Verdict
I'm really pleased with Vim-Qt and I love the control I get with those style
sheets. The Qt4 version feels stable to me and I plan to continue using it on
all of my machines.
