2017 marked the point where I transitioned from C++ systems programming to
wearing all hats and working primarily in Clojure and ClojureScript. It's when I
joined [OkLetsPlay](https://okletsplay.com) as a co-founder. The migration to
Clojure was with the utmost intention and it was the culmination of a few years'
worth of reflection upon where safety meets practicality, in terms of functional
programming. In building our flagship product beta, we chose several
technologies to help us along and a few of them really stood out. None of these
technologies are new to 2017, but they were most helpful to me in 2017.
