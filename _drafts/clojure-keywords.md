title: The five common forms of Clojure keywords
tags: [clojure, keyword, tutorial]

Depending on what libraries are being used, Clojure has a handful of various
different idiomatic forms keywords can take. When approaching some forms, like
those in [Datomic](http://www.datomic.com/), the overall intention may not be
immediately clear. For a new Clojure developer, it may also be unclear which
form should be the default, and why. This post aims to add some clarity on the
subject.
