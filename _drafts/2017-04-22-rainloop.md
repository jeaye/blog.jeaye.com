[RainLoop](TODO) is a web-based
[MUA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_client) similar to [Roundcube](TODO),
[MailPile](TODO), and the like. When looking to setup portable email access for
my wife, who no longer is happy with just Thunderbird, Rainloop seemed like a
reasonable choice. Here are some integration notes, as well as a review and some
ranting, based on my afternoon setting it up.

### Community vs Standard version
The [website for Rainloop](http://www.rainloop.net) is quite minimal, but so is
the setup itself. The [biggest decision](http://www.rainloop.net/purchase/) one
needs to make is whether or not to use the Community
([AGPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License)) version or
the Standard
([closed-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software)) version.
As of writing, for personal sites, the Community version lacks only one feature:
single-click updating. Instead, the user is directed to install the new version
atop the old one, manually.

#### No single-click updating?
As far as licensing is concerned, that's not a problem at all. The approach
where the core of a product can be open source, while some non-crucial features
cost money, is a pretty reasonable deal. Still, there's no need to use a
closed-source version just to get single-click updating. Manually updating
in-place, however, is error-prone, non-atomic, imperative, and not the NixOS
way. We can do better.
