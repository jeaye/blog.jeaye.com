When Firefox 57 arrived, NoScript 5 users were left with the unsettling reality
of not being able to selectively filter JavaScript with NoScript until NoScript
10 was released, a week or so later. Its release was poorly received, due to
bugs and a brand new UI. Now that the tides have settles, and the bugs have been
vanquished, NoScript users are still left with the brand new UI and little to no
official documentation. This post will serve as a guide for both old and new
NoScript 10 users to get up to speed.

* Columns: default, trusted, untrusted, custom
* Columns can be edited from any of the domains (link to forum bit)
* Default should be to allow nothing
* Root-level domains show up and also each used sub-domain
* To trust something, click the trusted column
* To make the trusting permanent, click the clock
* Trusting for HTTPS only (go to the options and enable this for all trusted)
* Revoke temporary permission
* Trust all temporarily
