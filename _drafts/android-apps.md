Trust is a difficult issue when it comes to computing, but the ecosystem
around it is especially bad on mobile. We live our lives within our mobile
phones, but they're also far less under our control than a typical laptop or
desktop. When you install an app, how can you know that it's benign? Furthermore,
when you upgrade it, how can you ensure it remains so? For the vast majority of
people, even technical people, these questions never arise. That alone isn't the
problem though; the real problem is that, when considered, the answers aren't very convincing.

### Google Play
Google Play is the de facto way of installing apps on an Android device. It goes
without saying. However, that convenience comes at a cost. The most obvious is
privacy, but that cost is better understood. Another cost is security, since
you have no way of knowing the intentions of the apps you install through Google
Play. Notoriously, Google is known to allow just about any app onto Google Play,
with minimal review. This has lead to Google Play being a cesspool of malware
and mirror apps, which are design to look like an existing legitimate app, but
are unofficial and entirely untrustworthy.

#### Integrity
If you trust a company, you may feel comfortable installing its apps from the
Play Store. For example, Open Whisper Systems, the company behind
[Signal](https://signal.org/), may hold your regard. However, *whenever you
install anything from Google Play*, you also need to [trust
Google](https://www.expressvpn.com/blog/google-play-targeted-by-nsa/). Even if
the Open Whisper Systems uploads an entirely benign application to Google Play, that doesn't
mean it's what you're downloading. Furthermore, you have absolutely no way of
verifying the app's integrity, given the existing tech built into Android's app
installation flow.

#### Open source
You can find respite in open source apps though, right? Not quite. Even if an
app is open source, you run into the same exact problem when you install it from
Google Play.

*Is the binary derived directly from the source you see, or has it
been modified? What about the updates?*

There are distribution platforms specifically for open source apps, too. The
most popular is, perhaps, F-Droid.  Alas, apps on F-Droid are still distributed
as binaries. Even worse, they're not all signed by the developers, they're
signed by the maintainer of F-Droid.

#### Permissions
Fortunately, within the Google Play mayhem, at least apps are bound by their
permissions! â€¦right? Yes, it's true. In fact, it's one of the nicest things
about smart phones; an app installed on your desktop or laptop pretty much has
free reign over all your files and other apps. On a smart phone, however, each
app is bound by some permissions which are either accepted at install or
dynamically, as they're required. Assuming you're an impervious warden of your
own phone, you unfortunately still have to worry apps with even the most benign
permission grants.

Let's say you're an avid note taker with a generally poor sense of direction, so you've installed your favorite notepad app, as well as your favorite chat app. After fastidiously checking the permissions, you've discerned the following.

##### Notepad permissions
* Read/write disk access (to save your notes)

##### Chat permissions
* Read disk access (to attach your photos and such)
* Internet access

It's reasonable; each app has only what it needs to serve its purpose.  Alas,
apps are not entirely siloed and, even with the barest of permissions, they can
talk to each other through intents, links, and any common grants. In this case,
if the chat app's distributor so desired, you might find it's uploading your
saved notes (bank account info, personal details, etc), since it has both disk
and network access. If the developer of the chat app is also the developer of
the notepad app, you may find they're working together to make this easier.

What about a map app which has access to your GPS, but nothing else? That info
can then be stored and read by the chat app, or something else with internet
access, so the GPS data can be uploaded.

Sound crazy? Well, [Baidu did it
already](https://www.virusbulletin.com/blog/2018/03/vb2016-paper-wild-android-collusions/). This is called *app collusion* and it's more complicated than the above illustration, but it's very much the same principle.

### Generate a keystore

```bash
keytool -genkey -v \
        -keystore self-built.keystore -storetype pkcs12 \
        -alias self-built \
        -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 \
        -validity 365 
```

### Sign the unsigned APK
```bash
jarsigner -verbose \
          -sigalg SHA1withRSA \
          -digestalg SHA1 \
          -keystore self-built.keystore \
          app/build/outputs/apk/standard/release/app-standard-release-unsigned.apk \
          self-built
```
